title: Metis MTA data project!

## Metis Bootcamp first project

My cohort just finished our first week at Metis Bootcamp in Seattle.  We come from various backgrounds, all wanting to learn more about data science.   

Our first project was done in teams of four.  What a great way to get to know each other.  As with most teams, we each brought different strengths to the project.  

Now let’s move into the imaginary world of a data science team from the company Toucan Analysis, Inc. which has been presented a problem to solve by the New York organization, WomenTechWomenYes.

Chad and Roberto -   

It was great to meet with you and chat at the event where we 
recently met and had a nice chat. We’d love to take some next 
steps to see if working together is something that would make 
sense for both parties.   

As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of 
data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street 
team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising 
efforts.   

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has an annual gala at the beginning 
of the summer each year. As we are new and inclusive organization, 
we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event 
space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation 
of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach.   

To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. 
The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up 
are sent free tickets to our gala.   

Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway 
data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the 
city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such 
that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who 
will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.   

The ball is in your court now—do you think this is something 
that would be feasible for your group? From there we can explore 
what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.   

Best,

Karrine and Dahlia

WTWY International
