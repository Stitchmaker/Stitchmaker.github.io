I am a student at a Metis Bootcamp in Seattle, WA, working to transition into data science.  I have a PhD from MIT with a focus on numerical methods for simulating compressible fluid flow.  Many of the fundamentals from my PhD work are also the fundamentals of data science.  I'm excited to join this new field of computational analysis.
